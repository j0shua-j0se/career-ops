<!-- Block G signal 9 — Third-Party Platform Location Tag vs. Employer's Own Posting Mismatch. Verbatim from modes/oferta.md's former Block G; read when oferta.md's trigger index says it applies, and apply in full. "The tier below" means the Assessment tiers in modes/oferta.md → Block G → Output format.

**9. Third-Party Platform Location Tag vs. Employer's Own Posting Mismatch** (conditional — only when both sources are available):

Possible causes include the job board auto-guessing or mis-scraping the location field, or a recruiter selecting the wrong region tag when cross-posting the same requisition to multiple markets. This can result in a candidate applying based on the platform-displayed location (thinking it's local), when the role is actually in a different country entirely — and not finding out until much later in the process.

This signal only triggers when **both** a third-party platform's displayed location (e.g. LinkedIn, Indeed) **and** the employer's own job page's stated location are available to compare, **and** both sources can be confirmed to refer to the same requisition/job ID (e.g. a matching req number or job ID visible on both sides) — not merely the same title or company, which can still represent two genuinely different requisitions. Evidence may come from what the user pasted/screenshotted, or — only when running the browser-backed `auto-pipeline` (not `openai-eval.mjs`, which passes JD text only into Block G and has no Playwright/browser access) — from `auto-pipeline`'s Playwright snapshot if it captures both. If only one source is available, or the two sources cannot be confirmed to share a requisition/job ID, skip this signal entirely.

When both are available, compare the two stated locations. Flag only if they name **different countries** — not just different cities within the same country, which is a much weaker/more ambiguous signal (e.g. genuine multi-office companies with several valid postings).

If triggered, append a short, non-alarmist note to the report:

> ⚠️ **Location tag mismatch signal:** This posting shows "{platform location}" on {platform name}, but the employer's own job page for the same posting states "{employer-page location}." Confirm the actual work location directly with the employer before assuming the platform-displayed location is accurate — this is sometimes a cross-posting/tagging error, not necessarily deceptive.

This signal does not change the High Confidence / Proceed with Caution / Suspicious tier below — it is orthogonal to ghost-job detection and is reported separately.

**Scope note:** This signal is prompt-instruction-only for now — the agent manually compares the two sources when both are present in what the user provided. It does not modify `check-liveness.mjs` or `liveness-core.mjs` to automatically fetch and compare both pages; that is out of scope for this pass and left as a future decision.
